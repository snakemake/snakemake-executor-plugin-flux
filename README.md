# Snakemake Executor Flux

This is an example implementation for an external snakemake plugin.
Since we already have one for Flux (and it can run in a container) the example
is for Flux. You can use this repository as a basis to design your own executor to work
with snakemake!

## Usage

### Tutorial

For this tutorial you will need Docker installer.

[Flux-framework](https://flux-framework.org/) is a flexible resource scheduler that can work on both high performance computing systems and cloud (e.g., Kubernetes).
Since it is more modern (e.g., has an official Python API) we define it under a cloud resource. For this example, we will show you how to set up a "single node" local
Flux container to interact with snakemake using the plugin here. You can use the [Dockerfile](examples/Dockerfile) that will provide a container with Flux and snakemake
Note that we install from source and bind to `/home/fluxuser/snakemake` with the intention of being able to develop (if desired).

First, build the container:

```bash
$ docker build -f example/Dockerfile -t flux-snake .
```

Note that this currently uses a [custom branch](https://github.com/vsoch/snakemake/tree/add/executor-plugins) to install Snakemake.
We will add the plugin to `/home/fluxuser/plugin`, install it, and shell in as the fluxuser to optimally interact with flux.
After the container builds, shell in:

```bash
$ docker run -it flux-snake bash
```

And start a flux instance:

```bash
$ flux start --test-size=4
```

Go into the examples directory (where the Snakefile is) and run snakemake, targeting your executor plugin.

```bash
$ cd ./example

# This says "use the custom executor module named snakemake_executor_flux"
$ snakemake --jobs 1 --executor flux
```
```console

And that's it! Continue reading to learn more about plugin design, and how you can also design your own executor
plugin for use or development (that doesn't need to be added to upstream snakemake).

## Developer

### Instructions

These are general instructions for the naming of your library.

1. The plugin module should have the prefix `snakemake_executor_<name>`
2. The name of your executor is assumed to be the last term (e.g., `<name>` or "flux" here)
3. The library name, if provided via pypi to be installed with pip, should follow the same convention, but using dashes, e.g., "snakemake-executor-flux"

Instructions for writing your plugin with examples are provided via the [snakemake-executor-plugin-interface](https://github.com/snakemake/snakemake-executor-plugin-interface).
